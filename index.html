    <h1>HFO Sync &mdash; Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> February 20, 2026</p>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>HFO Sync is a personal-use application that connects to social media platform APIs (including Instagram Graph API and TikTok API) to retrieve account data for the sole use of the account owner. It is not a public-facing service and does not collect, store, or share data from any third-party users.</p>
    <h2>Data We Access</h2>
    <p>HFO Sync accesses the following data from your social media professional accounts via their respective APIs: account profile information (username, bio, follower/following counts), media posts and videos (captions, timestamps, media type, engagement metrics such as likes, comments, saves, reach, shares, and views), stories and story insights, and audience demographic summaries.</p>
    <h2>How Data Is Used</h2>
    <p>All data is stored locally on the account owner's personal computer in a SQLite database. It is used solely for personal analytics, content strategy, and performance tracking. Data is never transmitted to external servers, sold, or shared with any third party.</p>
    <h2>Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
    <p>Data is stored exclusively on the local filesystem of the account owner's machine. Access tokens are stored in a local configuration file with standard filesystem permissions. No cloud storage or third-party databases are used.</p>
    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Data is retained locally for as long as the account owner chooses to keep it. The account owner may delete all data at any time by removing the local database file.</p>
    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>Users may request deletion of their data at any time by contacting danhogberg@gmail.com. Since all data is stored locally, the account owner can also delete data directly by removing the local database and configuration files.</p>
    <h2>Third-Party Sharing</h2>
    <p>HFO Sync does not share any data with third parties. No analytics services, advertising networks, or external APIs receive any of the data accessed by this application.</p>
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>This application is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13.</p>
    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>For questions about this privacy policy, contact: danhogberg@gmail.com</p>
    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
